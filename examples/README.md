# Example Code and Projects

Bundled examples are Arduino sketches, as the generic embedded ecosystem is pretty wide.

For non-Arduino examples, look at the [STM32 GitHub Example](https://github.com/electricui/stm32-dma-uart-eui) or [ESP32 GitHub Example](https://github.com/electricui/esp32-uart-eui).

Most of the Arduino example programs should be easily adaptable to any other generic C or C++ program.

# Arduino Examples

Examples in the `/basics` and `/demonstration` folders are intended for most arduino compatible boards. 

Some more complicated examples, such as the websockets and bluetooth transports require supporting hardware, and might need some minor tweaks depending on compatibility with any updates to 3rd party libraries.
