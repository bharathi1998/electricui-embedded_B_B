# Example Code and Projects

A large chunk of the examples folder are specifically Arduino sketches, as the generic embedded ecosystem is pretty wide.  

Most of the Arduino example programs should be easily adaptable to any other generic C or C++ program.

# Arduino Examples

Examples in the basics, intermediate and project folders are intended for most arduino compatible boards. 

Some more complicated examples, such as the websockets and bluetooth transports in `intermediate` will require supporting hardware, and might need some minor tweaks depending on compatibility with any 3rd party libraries.

Project examples cover some pretty common hardware, again, supporting hardware is required for unmodified programs to run.
